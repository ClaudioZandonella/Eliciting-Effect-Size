The present Shiny-App is an example of user-friendly method to directly elicit and formalize experts' knowledge about effect sizes when we are interested in the difference between the mean scores of two groups on a continuous variable. We used as an example boys and girls heights. 

<br>

<center><h4>
*Who is taller between boys and girls?*
</h4></center>

<br>

It looks like an easy question, but would you be able to evaluate how the average heights of boys and girls change according to age? <br>
The present App will drive the user through an elicitation process, using an adaptation of the 'trial roulette' approach [@gore_biostatistics_1987], to answer to the above question. The user will assign chisp on possible values according to his or her knowledge and uncertanty. 
<br>
However, users will not refer to heights in meters or centimeters, but to the probability of being taller in a comparison. This allows to consider effects sizes in terms of the *probability of superiority* [@ruscio_probability-based_2008; @vargha_critique_2000] or *Cohen's $U_3$* index [@cohen_statistical_1988]. These different formulations have the advantage to not refer to any unit of measure but only to probabilities.
